**Project Title:** Prediction of iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm
**Problem Statement:**A Amerian based botnical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technlogy in a single tree different types of vsriety flower is grow as as a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is there all categories contains same species.
Task1: Preprocess the data in skit.learn library

Task2:Load the data using sk learn model selection defoult argument

Task3:On the basis of data train test and split svm model

Task4:Impliment support vector mechanism classifier using svm classifier.The svm must be " Linear "

Task5:Train the classifier on the training data

Task6:Find out the prediction value on the test data

task7:Test the model with the help of accuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of o to 1

Conclusion:According to my support vector mechsnism model the species are linear with the accuracy of 1.00.Hene Provel model was successfully impliment
